â€¢ This portfolio website was built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, reflecting a personal touch and a passion for clean, 
  straightforward design. By sticking to these core technologies, I aimed to create a site that not only looks good but also works smoothly across different devices and browsers. 
  Each element was carefully crafted to showcase my work while ensuring that the user experience is both enjoyable and intuitive. 
  I hope you feel the effort and creativity that went into making this space truly represent me!
